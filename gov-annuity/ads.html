        <div class="ad-body">You've served 20+ years. You know your FERS annuity. But have you run your annuity computation?

High-3 average salary x years of service x 1% = your annual annuity.

For most GS-12s and GS-13s, that's 30-40% of your salary. The FERS Supplement bridges the gap until 62 — then it vanishes completely. Social Security helps, but it still won't match your current take-home.

"I did the math and my annuity is only going to be USD 2,100/month. How am I supposed to live on that?"

That's the most common reaction we hear. And the answer isn't to panic — it's to plan before you separate.

Our free 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint shows you your exact gap and exactly how FERS + TSP + Social Security + a fixed annuity work together to close it.

No sales call. No advisor contact. Just the math.</div>

        <div class="ad-body">You've been contributing to your Thrift Savings Plan for decades. Now you're approaching your MRA and the questions hit all at once:

Leave it in the G Fund? Roll it to an IRA? Roth conversion ladder? TSP annuity purchase? Monthly payments?

"My HR just processes paperwork — they can't give me financial advice. And I don't trust the advisor who cold-called me."

Sound familiar? You're not alone. The wrong TSP move at separation can trigger penalties, a massive tax bill, or lock you into high-fee funds for decades.

We built the 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint specifically for FERS employees facing this exact decision. It maps out every TSP option based on your age, years of service, and retirement timeline.

        <div class="ad-body">After 25 years of government service, you chose stability for a reason. You didn't pick the private sector. You picked guaranteed benefits.

Your FERS annuity is guaranteed for life. Social Security is guaranteed for life. But the gap between them and your actual monthly expenses? That's where the uncertainty lives.

What if a portion of your TSP could become a second guaranteed income stream — not subject to C Fund or S Fund swings, not dependent on withdrawal timing, just predictable income every month for life?

That's the "income floor" strategy inside our free 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint. It shows how FERS + TSP + a fixed annuity work together to cover 100% of your essential expenses with income you can never outlive.

Built specifically for FERS employees. Free. No obligation.</div>

        <div class="ad-body">Most government employees assume their FERS annuity + Social Security will cover their lifestyle. They don't run the computation until it's too late.

Let's do the math nobody at HR shows you:

High-3 salary: USD 95,000
Years of service: 25
FERS annuity: ~USD 23,750/year (USD 1,979/month)

That's before taxes. Before your FEHB premium. Before your survivor benefit reduction.

Could you live on that? Factor in Social Security at 62 and you're still looking at a USD 25,000-35,000 annual gap.

The mistake? Not planning for that gap BEFORE you file your retirement paperwork. Once you've separated, your options narrow dramatically — and with 54,000+ claims pending at OPM, you could wait 77+ days for your first full annuity payment.

Our free Blueprint shows the exact gap and how to close it while you still have time.</div>

        <div class="ad-body">When you separate from federal service, your TSP doesn't just follow you. You face a decision — and the wrong one can trigger:

• A 10% early withdrawal penalty (if you haven't hit 59½ — or 55 under the Rule of 55)
• A massive tax bill from an unnecessary Roth conversion
• Losing the TSP's 0.055% expense ratio for an IRA charging 10x more

The biggest mistake? Rolling everything to a high-fee IRA because an advisor told you to — without comparing it to your other options first.

Some of those advisors earn a 5% commission on the rollover. That's USD 25,000 on a USD 500K TSP. They're not giving you advice — they're making a sale.

        <div class="ad-body">Your FERS annuity guarantees income for life. Social Security does too. But what about the gap between them and your monthly expenses?

Most federal retirees leave their entire TSP in the G Fund — earning below inflation — or take ad-hoc withdrawals and hope it lasts. That's not a retirement strategy. That's hope.

The 2022 C Fund and S Fund losses terrified a lot of people close to retirement. Many panic-moved to the G Fund. Now they're earning 4% while inflation eats their purchasing power.

"I can't afford a 30% drop this close to retirement. I'd rather earn less and keep what I have."

There's a third option: convert a portion of your TSP into a guaranteed income stream that fills the gap — with no market risk and no guessing.

Our free Blueprint shows you exactly how much to allocate for guaranteed income that covers 100% of your essential expenses. For life.</div>

The real mistake? Making a TSP decision without knowing your numbers first.

        <div class="ad-body">You probably know your FERS annuity and your Social Security estimate. But do you know about the cliff?

The FERS Supplement — the bridge payment between your MRA and age 62 — disappears completely when you turn 62. And most federal employees don't realize it's also subject to an earnings test if you work part-time after separating.

That means your retirement income can DROP by USD 1,000-1,500/month overnight. One birthday. One cliff. Zero warning from OPM.

If you haven't planned for that cliff, you'll burn through your TSP way faster than expected.

Our free 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint shows you exactly when the cliff hits, how much income you lose, and the strategy to bridge it before it becomes a crisis.

This is specific to FERS employees. Nobody else has this problem.</div>

        <div class="ad-body">If you separate from federal service in or after the year you turn 55, you can withdraw from your TSP without the 10% early withdrawal penalty.

It's called the Rule of 55 — and it changes the entire calculus of your TSP strategy at retirement.

Most federal employees don't know this. They assume 59½ is the magic number for everything. And some advisors "forget" to mention it — because it means you might not need their IRA rollover.

There's more: the TSP offers an annuity purchase option that most employees have never explored, plus a monthly payment option that works like a paycheck.

Our free 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint breaks down every TSP option — withdrawals, monthly payments, rollovers, annuity purchase — and shows which one keeps the most money in your pocket based on your specific situation.

        <div class="ad-body">They don't have more money. They don't have better pensions. They just structured their retirement income differently.

Here's the strategy:

Step 1: Calculate your essential monthly expenses (housing, FEHB, food, utilities, insurance).
Step 2: Add up your guaranteed income (FERS annuity + Social Security).
Step 3: If there's a gap, fund a fixed annuity with a portion of your TSP to fill it.

Result: 100% of essential expenses covered by income that never stops — regardless of what the stock market does.

Everything above that line? Keep it in the C Fund, the L Fund, or an IRA for growth. Travel money. Grandkid money. Legacy money.

That's the "income floor" strategy — and it's inside our free 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint. See your exact numbers.</div>

        <div class="ad-body">Your TSP has a 0.055% expense ratio — one of the lowest-cost investment vehicles in the world. On a USD 500K balance, that's USD 275/year in fees.

A typical IRA charges 0.50% or more. That's USD 2,500/year — nine times as much.

So when an advisor suggests rolling your entire TSP into an IRA they manage, ask yourself: who benefits more from that move?

This isn't always bad advice. Sometimes an IRA rollover IS the right move — especially if you need investment options the TSP doesn't offer. But the only way to know is to compare the numbers yourself, without someone who earns a commission on the outcome.

Our free 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint shows you both scenarios side by side. TSP vs. rollover. Fees. Taxes. Income projections.

No advisor. No pitch. Just your numbers.</div>

        <div class="ad-body">Let's do your annuity computation.

GS-13 Step 10: USD 119,146/year
High-3 average salary: ~USD 116,000
Years of service: 25
FERS annuity (1%): USD 29,000/year → USD 2,417/month
Social Security (at 62): ~USD 1,833/month
Gross retirement income: ~USD 4,250/month

Your current take-home (after TSP contributions): ~USD 6,800/month

The gap: USD 2,550/month. USD 30,600/year.

And that's before the FERS Supplement disappears at 62. Before FEHB premiums without the employer contribution. Before your survivor benefit election reduces your annuity 5-10%.

How long does your TSP last if you're pulling USD 2,550/month to fill that gap? At a 4% withdrawal rate, you'd need USD 765,000 just for the gap — and that assumes no market downturns.

There's a better way. See your exact numbers in our free 2026 Blueprint.</div>

But USD 500K doesn't mean USD 500K in income.

4% withdrawal rule: USD 20,000/year → USD 1,667/month
TSP annuity purchase: ~USD 2,700/month (approximate, age-dependent)
Monthly TSP payments over 25 years: ~USD 2,200/month (assumes 5% return)

Three completely different numbers from the same balance. And that's before taxes.

Now factor in: What if you retire into a bear market and your C Fund drops 25% in year one? Your USD 500K becomes USD 375K, and your 4% withdrawal is now USD 1,250/month.

"I can't afford a 30% drop this close to retirement."

Essential monthly expenses: USD 5,200
FERS annuity: USD 2,480/month
Social Security (at 62): USD 1,833/month
Gap: USD 887/month

A fixed annuity funded by ~USD 175,000 of your TSP can produce approximately USD 950/month — guaranteed for life. No market risk. No sequence-of-returns risk.

That means: 100% of your essential bills are covered by income you can never outlive.

Remaining TSP (USD 225K+): Keep it invested for growth, travel, or legacy. If the market drops, your bills are still paid.

This is the "income floor" strategy — and it's why federal retirees who use it sleep better than those guessing at withdrawals.

2. Your Social Security at 62 vs 67 vs 70 — each year you delay past 62 increases your benefit ~7%

3. The monthly gap — the difference between your guaranteed income and your actual expenses

If you don't know all three, you're not ready to retire.

Most FERS employees can compute #1 but get stuck on #2 and #3. Especially #3 — because nobody factors in the FERS Supplement cliff, FEHB premium changes, survivor benefit reduction, and taxes.

Our free 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint calculates all three in 2 minutes. Plus shows you exactly how to close the gap if there is one.

Before you agree, compare:

TSP annual fee on USD 500K: USD 275/yr (0.055%)
Typical managed IRA fee on USD 500K: USD 2,500-6,250/yr (0.50-1.25%)
20-year TSP fee total: USD 5,500
20-year IRA fee total: USD 50,000-125,000
Advisor upfront commission: up to 5%

Does the IRA offer advantages that justify 10-20x the cost? Sometimes. If you need specific bond funds, real estate exposure, or Roth conversion flexibility — maybe.

But you should know these numbers BEFORE the advisor makes the pitch. Not after you've already signed.

        <div class="ad-body">The #1 question we hear from FERS employees approaching retirement:

"What do I do with my TSP?"

It's not a simple answer. It depends on your age, years of service, tax bracket, other income sources, the FERS Supplement timeline, and whether you need guaranteed income or growth.

Your HR office processes paperwork — they don't give financial advice. And the advisor who cold-called you? They specialize in getting your money, not in understanding FERS.

That's why we built the 2026 Federal Retirement Income Blueprint. It takes your specific situation — as a federal employee, not a generic retiree — and maps out exactly how your TSP fits into your total retirement income picture.

Over 2,000 FERS employees have already used it. It's free and takes 2 minutes.</div>

        <div class="ad-body">After working with thousands of FERS employees, one pattern is clear: the retirees who sleep best aren't the ones with the biggest TSP balances.

They're the ones whose essential expenses are 100% covered by guaranteed income.

They use three layers:
Layer 1: FERS annuity (guaranteed for life)
Layer 2: Social Security (guaranteed for life)
Layer 3: Fixed annuity from a portion of TSP (guaranteed for life)

When the market dropped in 2022, these retirees didn't lose a minute of sleep. Their bills were covered. The rest of their TSP could recover on its own timeline.

"I can't afford a 30% drop this close to retirement. I'd rather earn less and keep what I have."

You don't have to choose. The income floor strategy lets you do both. See how it works with your numbers — free.</div>

Because it wasn't built by OPM. It was built specifically for FERS employees who need one clear answer, not another 200-page handbook.
